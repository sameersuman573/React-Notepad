# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

#just we learn 4 things
1. store
2. slice and reducers

<!--  Slice Logic: A slice contains the reducer function responsible for handling state changes related to the slice. The reducer function typically takes the current state and an action as parameters and returns a new state based on the action type. -->

3. usedispatch - To update values in the store - read Addtodo
4. useselector - To Access the values from the store - read Todo


1. configure store - first create your store
2. create reducers(slices)- it is called slices -todoslice read
3 To create slice we neeed three things that are
// name 
// initial state
// reducers - full list
4. exporting all the reducers as individual functionality

as of now we have leraned store and reducers



5. send the data - dispatch
6. get the data
